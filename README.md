This is my set of solutions to Altera's Digital Logic Laboratory Exercise example labs. These were done as part of a course(Digital Electronics and System Design) I took at university during the Fall of 2016. I am publishing this code because I found these labs challenging and had a hard time getting help on them. However, the labs did help me learn VHDL (and Hardware Description Languages in general) and I recommend trying to complete the labs without these solutions first.

I have only included the VHDL source files and the entire project directory. I wasn't sure how the project files would migrate between versions of Quartus, but the VHDL files should always be fine. I collected these solutions a few months after completion of the labs, so hopefully I didn't miss any important files. Lab 9,10,11 and 12 is missing due to time contstraints, but the remainder of the digital logic labs are present. 

for any questions regarding these lab solutions please inbox my facebook page given below.
